It is midsem time and here I go for the group study. But group study not a very
simple thing and it is not hard to screw it up. I believe if good coordination
is achieved two or three heads are always better than one. 
Back in my JEE days I used to study with my friend Sudeep and it turned out to
quite awesome. We never "read" anything together. We used to just sit together and
solve the exercises. We used to put a timer decide how many questions we were
going to solve and solve them independently rarely speaking a single word to
each other during that period and time was over, we would check our answers,
calculate the marks and then thoroughly discuss each question. We would make
sure if any one of us got the answer correct both of us would know how the
other one reached that answer, and for the questions we both got correct we
would dicuss all the alternative approaches and for the questions none of us
could get we would try it out again and if even after that we couldn't get it
would note it down and discuss it with the coaching teacher. 
Because we were not reading or doing the problem solving "together" we were not
interfering with the thought process of the other and because we discussed each
question we could share our insights and remove the flase positives from our
knowledge. 

I need not mention the benifits of group study when done right. But there are
a few things that should be kept in mind while doing the planning for a group
study. 

1. It is important with whom and with how many people you study with. 

   With a large a group more four it turns out to hard to study effectively because it is
   hard to coordination and the group naturally tends to break in smaller sub
   groups. 
   And obviously you should study with someone you are comfortable with. 

2. Avoid doing too much together. 

   You should not do everything together. Make sure the other person get enough
   enough time to think for himself, and you don't intrupt their thought
   process

3. It is will be great if you have an awesome group to study with but It is OK
   if you don't get a group to study with.
