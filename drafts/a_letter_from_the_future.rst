Hi Diary Daisy,
Today, you know today I saw on news, that a team of researches who went to the
planet have found many disc like
the planet. Do you know humans ones used to live there and
then we moved out of there because the enviornment of earth became increasingly
unfavorable. News said some old folks claimed that these discs were used to
store data on them. My grandad told that his grandad used to live on earth and
they used to have big bulky computers weighing as much as two kg. I wonder what
life was back then. I also heard people back then used to use other animals as
their tools. They used to have a rope on their neck, and then used to
roam with them as if it were my toy. Then some of them used to put them on
their field and made them work on their fields. And many of them were raised to
be killed and eaten. And the worst thing is people didn't think it were wrong.
They used to give arguments from Bible and other religious texts as if they
didn't have a mind of their own. They used to say humans have been taking meat
from eternity. If you have been doing a bad thing from a long time that doesn't
mean you will continue to do so in the future too. Some crazy people even used
to say that it is even good, not only for them but also for the poor creatures
who used to get their heads off their body. The argument was "we give them food
and shelter and security and in turn they give us meat". Why didn't they
extended their argument to eat their fellow human beings, or use them as
property, made them work in their fiels and trade them as goods. Maybe they
used to look too much like them to contemplate this idea without thinking that
same could have been done to them. And what if the other people we are bit too
different, maybe a different skin color, just like my friend Sudheer. Will they
still say it is good thing to do the same to them too. Such planet would have
been a disaster. I'm glad it not there anymore.
