Reading Research Papers
=======================

I'm a memember of AGV Autonomous Ground Vechicle Team of IIT KGP. Since I've
joined here most of my work involved reading research papers and reports and to
see how it is relevant to our project. To me the best way to retain/gain
knowledge is to apply it but most of the time it hard to apply the knowledge
you gained and many times it becomes hard for me to know if I have understood
the paper of not. One method which my friend suggested is, read the paper 
to a point you are convinced that you have understood it, then write a paper
which tries to explain the paper to someone else. It is not necessary to
remember every detail but you must be able to explain the core idea
convincingly, it is not necessary to remember every equation used but you must
be able to derive them. From now on I'm gonna try it post the gist of every
paper I read on this blog. 
Good luck to Me!! :)
