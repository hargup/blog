Online Courses and Deadlines
============================

5th November

.. I think MOOC's are great. There are so many of them and there is a always
.. a urge to learn everything, so enrole in many courses but I rarely complete
.. them or watch more few lectures. But there are also many courses I truly want
.. but complete, then som

Coursera is trying to put university experience online, therefore they usually
have strict dealines on the assignment and fixed course starting and end dates.
In my case many times these dealine had a negative impact on my course
experience. The dealines set keeping in mind the enviornment of host university
because many times a similar chalk and blackboard course is held in the same
timespan in the university. So, they don't incorperate other commitments and
priorities of the students. They are not flexible enough at individual level.

On the other hand Udacity doesn't have dealines at all. There is no end date of
the course, all lectures and assignments are available all the time, you can
do the course at your own pace and earn the certificate whenever you are done.
Udacities approach appears to be more practical for online course. But coursera's approach
has it's own advantages. In the winter vacatation last december I started two
courses simultaneously on Udacity, Algorithms - Crunching the social network
and Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science - Solving Hard Problems. The
courses are great.I was roughly half the through both the courses when the
vacation ended. But after the vacation I didn't gave enough time to the
courses. Many times I thought that I should complete those courses but because
there was no dealines and no urgency I never got the priorities right and still
I've not completed the course. The dealines on assignments gives the little
push to keep doing the course dispite of the fast that we also have other
important things to do. Manybe a hybrid approach to dealines should work
better. For courses without peer review the students should be able to set
their own dealines for course and if they don't meet the dealine there can be
a rule that they won't get the certificate of completion.
