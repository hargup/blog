The Facebook experiment
=======================

The experiment is simple, scilently deactivate your account for a week.
Don't tell anybody that you did it don't discuss facebook explicitly.
Then count the number of people who notices that you are not there on Facebook
anymore. In my case only two people noticed me not on Facebook, first my mother
and second a friend who wanted to contact me for some work. I sense people
don't really care if you are on facebook or not. Try it and post it on your
comments, in case I get read.
