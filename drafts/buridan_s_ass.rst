Buridan's ass
=============

Many times I feel overwhemed with the sheer number of things I have to do or
I want to do. And most of the times I end doing either nothing or end up being
mediocre in all of them. I end being Buridan's Ass who can't decide wether to
drink water first or to eat the hay stack and ends up dying both or thirst and
starvation. This is not the first time I thought of priortising things or to
reduce the number of things I have/want to do. But no matter how few things
I have to do, I always create or find new and interesting and unrelated
problems to work on, stuff to learn or work to do. This in not a problem in
itself but the problem is I don't on most of the things to create any value out
of it. A large part of it has to do with the way I take breaks and the way
I procastinate. I realize the reason I procastinate when working on something
is not that I don't find the work intersting or valuable enough, but because
the problem appears so complicated or the work appears so large that it
unconciously scares the hell out of me. The first thing here is to reason why
I'm procastinating and if it is fear, don't give up. 
The other is thing is breaks. There are mainly three conditions when I take
break, first is when a subpart of the work I'm doning is complete.
Second is when I'm forced to take a break like I had to go to lab for work or
there is some meeting. Third is when I'm struck. In third case rather than
relaxing I browse the web and there I something interesting which takes my
frame of mind away from the problem and because I was struck at the position
where I left it become hard to restart the things. And the same thing happens
in first and second case I find something intersting in the meanwhile and it
takes my attention away. I should have a policy of taking things to some
showable level. Even writing a blog post about it enough.
