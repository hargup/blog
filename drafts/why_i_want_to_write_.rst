Why I want to write?
====================

30th October 2013

I started this blog with a intention of writing regularly, at least weekly. I'm
using a online an online reminder service called beeminder to sting me to do
it. Ok so, here is me asking myself why I want to write regularly and why don't
I do it or why I try to find ways to not to do it. Because this in not the
first time I've decided I want to write regularly. Paul Graham wrote on his
blog that he writes because writing helps him think better, it forces him to
clarify his thoughts and help him to remove the false positives in his
reasoning. That's also a reason I want to write. But I want to write for
writing's sake. I want to write to express myself, get my voice heard. I want
to write for the nostalgia and I want to write to show off.
So, why am I not writing. First of all it is easy not to do it. There is no
direct or imidiate consiquence of not writing, also there is no immidiate
reward of writing. And because it not urgent and slow other things takes
priority. For the time being beeminder and taken a job to put it in the
priority list. Second is the fear of not writing good enough, good enough not
in the artistic way but it the fear of being wrong on the internet, being wrong
in the public. But now I think I should not worry about it too much. Because if
I get read I'll get corrected eventually and I don't get read it doesn't matter
anyway. Third there is a confusion many times about what to write? Paul Graham
has given a good advice on writing essays here. He said write not in the way
you were tought in school, by that he meant don't write to a specific theme or
to present a point but write to discover and surprise. Start with some thing
you have thought a lot about and then write about it. Also I intended to use
this blog a development-log. But I've not done much showable stuff to write
about them here. I guess I should not worry too much and write what ever comes
in my mind.
