If you have not done anything wrong then you don't need to hide anything -- is BS
=================================================================================

Why?

Short answer:
Your wrong and your neighbour's might not be the same.
People are not as empathatic and responsible as you want them to be.
Knowledge is powerful, valuable and it's a agent of change for both good and
the bad.

Now longer answer:

First of all acts cannot be always labeled as good or bar, wrong or right.
Manytimes you cannot even assign them a shade of gray. What will you say of "
The Prime Minister of India painted his house GREEN". You cannot say he did
a right thing to paint it red, you cannot definitely say he did a wrong thing.
He just like the color GREEN.
Ok, so how does it matter if somebody or everybody knows this, does it really
matter. Well it doesn't if people understand this information is irrelevant,
and they act responsibly. But it would be horrible if I see a newpaper
headlines "PM painted his house GREEN to show he support to Pakistan inspite of
the recent terror attact in Delhi". And the opposition will make a big deal
out of it. The act of painting his house red won't matter if the media acts in
a responsible fashion or the opposition acts in a responsible fashion. But we
all know we don't always do it.
The mere act of painting the house green can be turned into a high profile political drama.
It's not just the knowledge itself but also the way it is presented and in what
context it is presented changes our perception of it. And I would not like to
give away my personal information to someone whom I don't trust.

Then there are cases where your wrong and your right doesn't concide with
other's wrong or other's right. Or cases where what you think as un

How does this argument apply to me, a *ordinary* person with *ordinary* friends
and family. Suppose you are a fifteen years old teen.
