Peer group and Heirarchy
========================

3 November 2013
It is a bad draft with random not coherent thought about something I discussed
with Sanyam.

In a peer group(group of friends) the common attribute among them tends to
enhance and other attributes tend to get neglected.
You like it or not you judge people and other people judge you. And those
judgement decide the social heirarchy. There can be many parallel heirarchies
based on various parameters. The social heirarchies are their and if you don't
like you can simply opt out by ignoring the other people on their judgement and
being not present when they gossip. I think we can feel if someone looks down
on us and if you enough time with them you are part of the social heirarchy
because you feel your position in the heirarchy and you'll at least sub
conciously want to imporve upon that. I guess that's the reason I'm little shy
and fear social judgement, but may be I should simply ignore people's comments
and opinion about the things I don't care too much about.
We tend to spend more time with people with similar interests and field of
works.
-- Heirarchies are important and people in the peer group are likely to be
judged on their common attributes. The people in the peer have a similar
level on the social Heirarchy because if the don't have the people in lower in
Heirarchy tends to break off and form their own group.
People tend to mantain their level in the social heirarchy, and that forces
them to improve upon the attributes they are judged on. If they don't they
naturally opt-out.
