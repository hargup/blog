After all the reasons to write and maintain history it's the time to do so.
So, here's a lil introduction of me, formally I'm second year "undergradute" student at IIT
Kharagpur studing mathematics. But it don't tell much of me does it. Let me try
again, I'm someone who likes to write code for fun, but it doesn't tell much of
me. Two years ago I liked to solve physics and maths problems for fun , I still
do. But still it doesn't tell you anything about how I feels to be "me".
I don't think there is a simple you way to do it, because there is no simple
way I feel about my self. And the only way to do it can only showing it and not
by telling. But there is no simple way to show it to you, so, I'll anyway tell
you.
You know I don't talk much, and I kinda feel bad about it. I just don't have
a toung to express my "heart", which is actually brain. So, it is my hollidays
I'm living with my parent in my home, I don't talk to them much, I guess
I should. Then there are manything I'm concerned about, K I'm giving up.
I hope someday I develop a toung to express itself.

Good Luck
Harsh
