From the last few days I've been trying out tinkerer and sphinx to create
static websites and they are pretty good. While working I get a feeling that
many times people do an overkill making dynamic websites with php or Ruby on
Rails because they simply don't need an dynamic websites. By dynamic websites
I mean the websites which create the content from the data on the database
Static websites have a lot of advantages over dynamic websites

1. Static websites are easier of create.

   With a lot of free (as in free speech) static websites creators available
   online we can create good looking static websites with reasonable amount of
   control. 

2. Static websites are safer.

   Because there is no database, no user managment and no admin panel there is
   simply no scope of changing the content of the website with most of the
   attack strategies.

3. Static websites are cheaper and easier to maintain. 

   You can get your static website hosted for zero or very little cost as I'm
   doing for my blog. No one will let you do this for a website running on php
   and mysql.

4. Because you might not need to create content dynamically.
