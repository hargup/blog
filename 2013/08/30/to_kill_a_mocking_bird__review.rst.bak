The story is set in the America of 1940's a world which still see the *black*
as primitive and *bad* people, told wonderfully throught the innocent eyes of a six years old girl,
Jean. The black man Tom Robinson was accused of a raping a while woman and
Jean's Father was Atticus took the job of defending him. The book is about
racial discrimination, gender roles and biases, courage and innocense.
