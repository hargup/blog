<h1>Case for static websites</h1>
<p>From the last few days I’ve been trying out tinkerer and sphinx to create
static websites and they are pretty good. While working I get a feeling that
many times people do an overkill making dynamic websites with php or Ruby on
Rails because they simply don’t need an dynamic websites. By dynamic websites
I mean the websites which create the content from the data on the database
Static websites have a lot of advantages over dynamic websites</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Static websites are easier of create.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>With a lot of free (as in free speech) static websites creators available
online we can create good looking static websites with reasonable amount of
control.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Static websites are safer.</p>
<p>Because there is no database, no user managment and no admin panel there is
simply no scope of changing the content of the website with most of the
attack strategies.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Static websites are cheaper and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>You can get your static website hosted for zero or very little cost as I’m
doing for my blog. No one will let you do this for a website running on php
and mysql.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Because you might not need to create content dynamically.</p>
</li>
</ol>
