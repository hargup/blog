How to talk?
============

I'm an introvert and ,unfortunately, also a little shy person with not so good
comunications skill. I find it hard to talk to a stranger or even someone
I know but don't talk much with them. Most of time I just don't have an urge to
talk to them and it feels lame to do the small talk.


An introverts guide to small talk
==================================

I'm an introvert and ,unfortunately, also a little shy person with not so good
comunications skill. I find it hard to talk to a stranger or even someone
I know but don't talk much with them. Most of time I just don't have an urge to
talk to them and it feels lame to do when there is nothing specific you want to
talk about. Despite the bad reputation of small talk I think it is important.
If I only talk when I *have* to do talk to them or have anything specific to
talk to them about I might not make any new friends or meet no new people. So,
I asked friend what to do about and here's the list:

1. Find a common ground.

   Find out something you both know about and talk about it.

2. Ask them what's up with their life, How are you stuff?

   Don't do that. I've never found that turning into a exciting conversation at
   least not with strangers. No stranger will tell even the slightest of the
   details of their when asked this question. It will end up with "All is
   good", "I'm fine".

3. Ask them about what they are working on and what they find interesting.

4. Ask them what is their favoriate anime, TV show or Movie or book. All
   depends on the context

5. Read newspaper and talk about current events.

6. Remember to not to sound desperate. Don't sound as if you are desperate to
   talk

7. Show the intent to have a conversation with them again (if you want to)

8. It's ok it the other person doesn't seems to interested in you.

That the please of reading greate novels you get see how others seeyou and you
get to see how others see you.
