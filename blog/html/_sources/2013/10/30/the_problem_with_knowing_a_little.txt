The Problem with knowing a little
===================================

Written on: 29-05-13

Today I had to rename some files by appending .bak their name. I didn't wanted to rename the folders. I was using `mv <filename>{.,bak}`.
Then it occurred to me that I can probably use `regex` to that task. I googled it and found some not similar questions on stackoverflow.
They were not exactly what I wanted and I didn't knew enough `regex` or `bash` to do what I wanted. Finally I had to do it the normal and
it took me an hour. If I didn't knew there is something called `regex` I would not have tried it, or If had known enough `regex` I would
not have *wasted* an hour on it.
So, what's the conclusion. You cannot never completely know about something and you never know how much is enough. And you must know something
like `regex` exist to learn and use it. You cannot possibly get rid of the *alap vidyaa* (half knowledge), if you somehow succeed then you are probably living
in a void. The only thing which I think you can do is to complete things when you start them.
